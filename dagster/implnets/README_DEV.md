Note: Moved the dagster.yaml that defines the container based configuraiton to deployment.


To start a dev instance, you can type

set the environment variables in deploymnet/envFile.env 
   * 
   * if using jetbrains/pycharm, use a shell script, and add the env variables.


`dagster dev --workspace workspace_dev.yaml`


You can go to deployment, and get the code reloaded by reloading the definitions.
