## About

This repo is focused on the use of Dagster to build out code and Docker containers
to run the Gleaner and Nabu packages for indexing websites with JSON-LD based
structured data on the web.


Details of the approach can be found in the [github io](https://earthcube.github.io/scheduler/).

# **NOTE: v0_generated_code branch**

This is the original code that utilized a generate code approach to build the workflows.
This is where any config file updates should be done if using this code.
